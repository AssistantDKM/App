## How Can I Contribute?

### I found a bug and want to report it

First of all thank you for taking the time to check our guidelines before creating a Github issue ðŸ’ª

To help keep the issues manageable, please double check that the issue you have, has not been reported already in the issues list. Secondly please ensure that you fill in as much information as possible on the issue. The issue template should help you through the process, sometimes small details help us find the bug quickly.

### Suggesting a Feature

_**Please note:** Just because a feature ticket exists, does not mean that we will or can build the feature._ 

- Ensure that there is no existing feature request on the [issues page](https://github.com/AssistantDKM/App/issues)
- Research is required
  - Typically when a feature is built, there is a lot of time spent gathering the data, figuring out how we are going to make use of and store the data within the apps, figuring out how to localise (translate) the data displayed.
- Some things may not be possible or will take too much time.

You can create a feature request from [here](https://github.com/AssistantDKM/App/issues/new?assignees=&labels=idea&template=---feature-request.yaml)
